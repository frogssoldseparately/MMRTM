# AddOn Class

The backbone for creating add-on's with the modifier. All add-on classes extend this.

## Properties

### Static

**showAlerts**

```
   * Whether or not to show alerts from failed optional Snippet instance creation. Is true by default.
   * @type {boolean}
```

### Private

**#openInPopup**

```
   * Whether the add-on is open in a popup or not.
   * @type {boolean}
```

**#snippets**

```
   * Snippets generated by this add-on stored behind respective snippet names.
   * @type {Object}
```

### Public

**getAddOn**

```
   * Fetches an add-on, if it exists, from the Modifier instance. This allows for add-on's
   * to be able to communicate with each other without having to give them access to the
   * Modifier instance. Due to this desired isolation, this is set externally.
   * @param {string} addOnKey - The key property value of the desired add-on.
   * @returns {AddOn} The desired add-on instance.
```

**muted**

```
   * Whether or not some alerts and logs are omitted during building.
   * @type {boolean}
```

**promisedSnippets**

```
   * An array of snippets that must be created before the final write stage of the Modifier instance.
   * @type {Array<string>}
```

**stageManager**

```
   * The shared StageManager instance to control what is executed when within the AddOn instance.
   * This is set externally to ensure everything is synced up, and is one less thing that can be bugged
   * on an add-on by add-on basis.
```

### Getters

**snippetPaths**

```
   * Get all created snippets from this AddOn instance.
   * @returns {Array<string>} Array of snippet path names of the form "[this add-on key]/[snippet name]".
```

**missingSnippets**

```
   * Get all snippet names from promisedSnippets that don't yet exist.
   * @returns {Array<string>} Array of snippet names that weren't created.
```

**isPopup**

```
   * Get whether this add-on is a popup or not.
   * @returns {boolean} Whether or not this is a popup.
```

### Setters

## Methods

### Static

### Private

**#noImplementation**

```
   * Logs information about the passed function handle from an AddOn instance. Used for debugging.
   * @param {Function} handle - What AddOn function is being logged.
```

### Public

**setup**

```
   * Sets properties within this AddOn instance using property value pairs.
   * @param  {...any} args - Property value pairs.
```

**prep**

```
   * Sets properties within this AddOn instance using property value pairs. I'm not entirely sure
   * why this is a duplicate of AddOn.setup(), but it stays for now.
   * @param  {...any} args - Property value pairs.
```

**stage**

```
   * Execute a stage function based on stageManager's state. This does not consume any values held
   * by stageManager.
```

**now**

```
   * A skeleton to be implemented by an extending class. If unmuted, logs that this method
   * was unimplemented in the extending class.
```

**preBake**

```
   * A skeleton to be implemented by an extending class. If unmuted, logs that this method
   * was unimplemented in the extending class.
```

**bake**

```
   * A skeleton to be implemented by an extending class.
```

**postBake**

```
   * A skeleton to be implemented by an extending class. If unmuted, logs that this method
   * was unimplemented in the extending class.
```

**preWrite**

```
   * A skeleton to be implemented by an extending class. If unmuted, logs that this method
   * was unimplemented in the extending class.
```

**getSnippet**

```
   * Get a created Snippet instance by name.
   * @param {string} snippetName - The desired snippet's name.
   * @returns {Snippet} The desired Snippet instance. Returns undefined if the snippet does
   * not exist.
```

**getExternalSnippet**

```
   * Get a created Snippet instance by path name from another AddOn instance. This comes in the form of
   * "[add-on key]/[snippet name]". This is set by the Modifier instance.
   * @param {string} snippetPath - The desired snippet's path.
   * @returns {Snippet} The desired Snippet instance.
```

**newSnippet**

```
   * Creates a new Snippet instance from the contents of a provided script element, stores it within the AddOn instance,
   * and returns the same instance.
   * @param {string} name - The name used to access the created Snippet instance.
   * @param {HTMLScriptElement} domElement - The element whose contents are used to create a Snippet instance.
   * @param {string} type - How the domElement's content will be parsed by DOMParser.parseFromString(). The default
   * value of "text/html" should be good for most usecases.
   * @returns {Snippet} The Snippet instance that was created.
```

**newSnippetFromString**

```
   * Creates a new Snippet instance from a provided, parseable string, stores it within the AddOn instance, and
   * returns the same instance.
   * @param {string} name - The name used to reference the Snippet instance.
   * @param {string} string - The string that will be processed by DOMParser.
   * @param {string} type - What the string will be parsed as. The default value of "text/html"
   * should work for most usecases.
   * @returns {Snippet} The Snippet instance that was created.
```

**newOptionalSnippet**

```
   * Creates a new Snippet instance from the contents of a provided script element, stores it within the AddOn instance,
   * and returns the same instance if and only if testBoolean is true. If testBoolean is false, will instead show an
   * alert and remove the provided name from the promisedSnippets array.
   * @param {string} name - The name used to reference the Snippet instance.
   * @param {HTMLScriptElement} domElement - The element whose contents are used to create a Snippet instance.
   * @param {string} type - What the string will be parsed as. The default value of "text/html"
   * should work for most usecases.
   * @param {boolean} testBoolean - Whether or not the Snippet instance can be created.
   * @param {string} alertText - The text to show to the user if alerts can be shown.
   * @returns {Snippet} The Snippet instance created. If no Snippet instance was created, returns null.
```
